	<p id="_f751d52f-741c-17c6-b904-4fbad25afaec">CoverageJSON is a format for encoding coverage data like grids, time series, and vertical profiles, distinguished by the geometry of their spatiotemporal domain. A CoverageJSON object represents a domain, a range, a coverage, or a collection of coverages. A range in CoverageJSON  represents coverage values. A coverage in CoverageJSON is the combination of a domain, parameters, ranges, and additional metadata. A coverage collection represents a list of coverages.</p>
	
	<p id="_fbce7fbf-677b-d79c-0d44-4b2852557789">A complete CoverageJSON data structure is always an object (in JSON terms). In CoverageJSON, an object consists of a collection of name/value pairs — also called members. For each member, the name is always a string. Member values are either a string, number, object, array or one of the literals: true, false, and null. An array consists of elements where each element is a value as described above.</p>

	<p id="_ed368da1-332d-37bd-3fa1-1cba25c6f786">A CoverageJSON document can be extended with custom members and types in a robust and interoperable way. For that, it makes use of absolute URIs and compact URIs (prefix:suffix) in order to avoid conflicts with other extensions and future versions of the format. A central registry of compact URI prefixes is provided which anyone can extend and which is a simple mapping from compact URI prefix to namespace URI in order to avoid collisions with other extensions that are based on compact URIs as well. Extensions that do not follow this approach MAY use simple names instead of absolute or compact URIs but have to accept the consequence of the document being less interoperable and future-proof. In certain use cases this is not an issue and may be a preferred solution for simplicity reasons, for example, if such CoverageJSON documents are only used internally and are not meant to be shared to a wider audience.</p>
