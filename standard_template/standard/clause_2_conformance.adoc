== Conformance

Conformance with this specification shall be checked using the [JSON schema](https://github.com/covjson/covjson-validator/tree/main/schemas). The schema bundle has been incorporated into the [CoverageJSON Community Playground](https://covjson.org/playground/) which can test files for conformance. Simple guidance on CoverageJSON is available at the [Community Cookbook](https://covjson.org/cookbook/).

The one Standardization Target for this specification is the format of CoverageJSON.

In order to conform to this OGCÂ® Community Standard, a software implementation shall implement any CoverageJSON object as a valid JSON object that conforms to the CoverageJSON schema. 

All requirements-classes and conformance-classes described in this document are owned by the standard(s) identified.
